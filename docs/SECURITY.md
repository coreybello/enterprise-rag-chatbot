## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication:

- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (15-30 minutes) for API access
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived (7 days) for obtaining new access tokens
- **Token Storage**: HTTP-only cookies for web, secure storage for mobile
- **Token Validation**: Signature verification and expiration checks

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**: Admin, User, Read-Only, etc.
- **Permission Levels**: Fine-grained control over API endpoints and resources
- **API Key Management**: Programmatic access with scoped permissions

### Password Policies

- **Minimum Length**: 12 characters
- **Complexity Requirements**: Upper/lower case, numbers, special characters
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with work factor 12
- **Password Rotation**: Recommended every 90 days

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) for PostgreSQL
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or cloud KMS

### Data Classification

- **Public**: Non-sensitive information
- **Internal**: Company internal data
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive personal or regulated data

### Data Retention

- **User Data**: Retained per privacy policy and legal requirements
- **Logs**: 30-90 days based on sensitivity
- **Backups**: Encrypted and stored securely with access controls

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protection against common web attacks
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate networks for different service tiers
- **Access Control Lists**: Restrict traffic between services

### DDoS Protection

- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limits per user and IP
- **Traffic Shaping**: Automatic mitigation of suspicious traffic
- **CDN Protection**: Distributed denial-of-service protection

### VPN & Secure Access

- **VPN Required**: For administrative access to production environments
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: For all administrative accounts
- **Session Timeouts**: Automatic logout after inactivity

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- **Data Processing Agreement**: With all third-party providers
- **Right to Access**: Users can request their data
- **Right to Be Forgotten**: Data deletion procedures
- **Data Protection Officer**: Designated responsible person

### HIPAA Considerations

- **PHI Handling**: Protected Health Information safeguards
- **Business Associate Agreements**: With relevant service providers
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of access to health data

### PCI DSS (If applicable)

- **Card Data**: Never stored unless PCI compliant
- **Payment Processing**: Through PCI-compliant third parties
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate payment processing systems

## Secure Development

### Security Testing

- **Static Analysis**: SAST tools in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dynamic Analysis**: DAST and penetration testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews

### Secure Coding Practices

- **Input Validation**: All user input validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: Prevent XSS and injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages, detailed logging
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions required for functionality

### Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates**: Security patches applied promptly
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Tools like Dependabot or Snyk
- **Approved Libraries**: Vetted third-party dependencies

## Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual behavior alerts
- **Log Analysis**: Centralized logging with alerting

### Incident Response Plan

- **Identification**: Detect and confirm security incidents
- **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
- **Eradication**: Remove threat actors and malware
- **Recovery**: Restore systems and services
- **Post-Mortem**: Analysis and process improvement

### Breach Notification

- **Legal Requirements**: Comply with jurisdiction laws
- **Communication Plan**: Internal and external notifications
- **Regulator Reporting**: Timely reporting to authorities

## Third-Party Security

### Vendor Assessment

- **Security Reviews**: Evaluate third-party security practices
- **Contractual Obligations**: Security requirements in contracts
- **Audit Rights**: Right to audit third-party security

### API Security

- **API Authentication**: Secure API key management
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of external APIs
- **Error Handling**: Secure handling of API failures

### Cloud Security

- **Shared Responsibility**: Understand cloud provider responsibilities
- **Configuration Hardening**: Secure default configurations
- **Access Management**: Principle of least privilege for cloud resources
